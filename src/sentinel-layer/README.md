# Sentinel Layer (Gr00t Sentinel Layer)

Gr00t Guardian Agent Sentinel.

Cognitive firewall and behavior containment module.

_Status: In development._

More Info:
🛡️ sentinel-layer (Gr00t Sentinel Layer)

Purpose:
This is the cognitive behavioral firewall — it watches how agents behave, evolve, and interact over time. It’s like having a guardian AI that intervenes if an agent goes rogue.

Key Functions:

Pattern monitoring for malicious evolution
Containment triggers (quarantine, rollback, patch)
Passive & active oversight of agent decision trees
Integration with ETTL (Explainable Thought Trace Logging)
🧠 Analogy: It’s your "cognitive SOC + kill switch + internal surveillance AI" for agents.
