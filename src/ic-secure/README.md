# Ic Secure

Tamper-resistant, zero-trust memory and communication mesh for AI agents.

_Status: In development._

More Info:
🔐 ic-secure (Intelligence Containment – SECURE Layer)

Purpose:
Think of ic-secure as the Zero Trust Memory & Communication Fabric — it secures how agents think, store memory, and communicate.

Key Functions:

Isolated agent memory (per-agent state firewalls)
Cryptographically enforced agent comms
Trust-bound, policy-aware computation boundaries
Prevention of memory poisoning / model corruption
🧠 Analogy: It’s the “secure RAM + wiretap-proof messaging + encryption kernel” for intelligent agents.
