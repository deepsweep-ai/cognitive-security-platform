# 🧠 Gr00t Guardian Agent – Cognitive Drift Sentinel for AI Systems

**Gr00t Guardian Agent** is a lightweight behavioral sentinel that monitors AI agents and autonomous systems for signs of cognitive drift, decision anomalies, and policy violations in real-time.

> ⚠️ Built for the future of autonomous AI — this is your agent’s first line of defense.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

As AI systems evolve, they begin to:
- Make **unjustified decisions**
- Operate **outside of trained behavior**
- Experience **drift** without detection

The Guardian Agent acts as a **real-time boundary enforcer**, monitoring behavior and surfacing anomalies **before they lead to real-world consequences**.

## 🧬 Core Features

- ✅ **Cognitive Drift Detection** — flag AI behavior that exceeds defined risk thresholds
- ✅ **Plug-and-Play Config** — YAML-based threshold and interval control
- ✅ **Explainable Events** — simple, interpretable alerts from JSON log monitoring
- ✅ **AgentMesh Compatible** — designed to integrate with DeepSweep.AI’s Zero Trust Policy Engine (ZPE)

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepsweep-ai/cognitive-security-platform/gr00t-guardian-agent.git
cd gr00t-guardian-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Agent
python agent.py
3. Watch for Output
The agent will read demo_logs.json and alert on any event where drift_score >= drift_threshold.

🧪 Sample Output

[OK] {'timestamp': '2025-05-01T08:00:00Z', 'drift_score': 0.3}
[ALERT] Drift score exceeded: {'timestamp': '2025-05-01T08:01:00Z', 'drift_score': 0.85}
🛠 Configuration (sample_config.yaml)

drift_threshold: 0.8     # Threshold above which alerts are triggered
sleep_interval: 1        # Delay between each log evaluation (in seconds)
🔮 Part of a Bigger Vision

Guardian Agent is part of the DeepSweep.AI Cognitive Security Mesh, which includes:

🕸️ Guardian AgentMesh – modular containment and policy enforcement
📜 Cognitive Policies – pre-built Terraform/YAML/JSON policy packs
🧠 DeepSweep.AI – full platform protecting the intelligence layer
🎯 Want to Deploy in Production?

We’re currently accepting partners for pilot deployments of DeepSweep.AI. If you’re managing AI agents, edge systems, or autonomous platforms, we want to talk.

# Sentinel Guardian AI

_Status: In development._

More Info:
🛡️ sentinel-layer (Gr00t Sentinel Layer)

Purpose:
This is the cognitive behavioral firewall — it watches how agents behave, evolve, and interact over time. It’s like having a guardian AI that intervenes if an agent goes rogue.

Key Functions:

Pattern monitoring for malicious evolution

Containment triggers (quarantine, rollback, patch)

Passive & active oversight of agent decision trees

Integration with ETT/ETTL (Explainable Thought Trace Logging) module

🧠 Analogy: It’s your "cognitive SOC + kill switch + internal surveillance AI" for agents.
