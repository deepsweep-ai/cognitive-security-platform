The Cognitive Security & Governance Platform for Intelligent Systems - by DeepSweep.ai
# DeepSweep.ai – Cognitive Security & Governance Platform

**Cybersecurity Reimagined for the Age of Superintelligence**

DeepSweep.ai is the world’s first **Cognitive Security & Governance platform** built from the ground up to secure intelligent systems, AI agents, federated model meshes, and autonomous operations across edge, cloud, and hybrid environments.

Our platform doesn’t just protect the infrastructure — it protects **the intelligence layer**.

---

## Why DeepSweep.ai?

Modern AI ecosystems are vulnerable to:

- **Model drift**
- **Malicious evolution**
- **Autonomous agent corruption**
- **Invisible adversarial retraining**
- **Exploit chaining across federated models**

We protect intelligent systems where legacy cybersecurity fails.

## Platform Components (High-Level)

- **AgentMesh™** – Federated autonomous agent orchestration mesh
- **Gr00t Sentinel Layer** – Cognitive guardian for early threat containment
- **IC-SECURE** – Zero-trust memory integrity and agent communication layer
- **Federated Agent Memory Mesh** – Trust-preserving distributed intelligence fabric
- **Self-Patching Intelligence Mesh** – Autonomous and dynamic vulnerability remediation
- **ETTL (Explainable Thought Trace Logging)** – Auditability for decision-making pathways
